Dioxid is a PHP 5.3 MVC Framework, inspired by Tom Frosts
"Hydrogen" and the Zend Framework, licensed unter
The MIT License.

I've written this becourse I needed a very flexible and
powerful but yet small MVC Framework with very few restrictions.

I didn't like all the conventions I'd had to face with the
Zend Framework. Also with a growing project the internal held
objects getting real big, even if I don't need them.

So here it is: Dioxid. Consider this is alfa to beta software.
Its partly very messy. I'll clean this up and make it pretty
when all features are implemented.

The Documentation is very lousy and rough or is missing
completely  but I'll try to handle with this also later.

So if your having any querstions, drop me a line ;)
